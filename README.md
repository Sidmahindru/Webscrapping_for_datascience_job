What is web scraping?

Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet. As a part of the data science project, we often need to rely on SQL/NoSQL databases, APIs or ready-made CSV datasets. The problem is that- all the time we can not find data readymade available with us and need to fetch data from the web resources. Web scraping or web data extraction is an automatic software technique for extracting information from web-sites. Web scraping works based on identifying a structure of HTML tags in web-pages.
